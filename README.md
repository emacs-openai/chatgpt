# chatgpt
> Use ChatGPT inside Emacs

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-openai/chatgpt/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-openai/chatgpt/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This Emacs Code extension allows you to use the official OpenAI API to generate
code or natural language responses from OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)
to your questions, right within the editor.

*P.S. This plugin focuses on experience with making conversations with ChatGPT!*

## üíæ Installation

#### package.el

This package is available from [JCS-ELPA](https://jcs-emacs.github.io/jcs-elpa/).
Install from these repositories then you should be good to go!

Normally, you don't need to add `(require 'chatgpt)` to your configuration since
most `'chatgpt` commands are autoload and can be called without loading the module!

#### use-package

If you are using [use-package](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UsePackage),
add the following to your `init.el` file:

```elisp
(use-package chatgpt :ensure t)
```

or with `straight.el`:

```elisp
(use-package chatgpt
  :straight (chatgpt :type git :host github :repo "emacs-openai/chatgpt"))
```

#### Manual installation

Copy all `.el` files in this repository to `~/.emacs.d/lisp` and add the following:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'chatgpt)
```

## üîë Obtaining API key

To use this extension, you will need an API key from OpenAI. To obtain one,
follow these steps:

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). If you
don't have an account, you will need to create one or sign up using your Google
or Microsoft account.
2. Click on the `Create new secret key` button.
3. Copy the key and paste into the 'API Key' field under the 'openai' custom group settings.

When you create a new account, you receive $18 in free credits for the API which
you must use in the first 90 days. You can see pricing information
[here](https://openai.com/api/pricing/). 1000 tokens are about 700 words, and
you can see the token count for each request at the end of the response in the
sidebar.

## üî® Usage

To start this package:

```
M-x chatgpt
```

You will then be asked to insert your response; in this window, you press
<kbd>return</kbd> to send the message, and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>return</kbd>
to insert a newline like a normal browser!
